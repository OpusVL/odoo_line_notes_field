# line_notes_field
Adding the notes fields back onto the sales order lines and the invoice lines.

With version 8 (or was it 7) the notes fields were removed from the sales
order lines and invoice lines.  This module simply adds those fields back
into the module and the UI.  Note, it does not modify the reports (at least
yet).
